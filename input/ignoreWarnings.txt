# warning due to the reference to a sub-package 
The canonical URL for an Implementation Guide must point directly to the implementation guide resource, not to the Implementation Guide as a whole

# duplicated anchor ids
The html source has duplicate anchor Ids: 1

# usage of SNOMED CT
The IG is not for the international realm, and it uses SNOMED CT, so it should fix the SCT edition in the expansion parameters

# no performers in the examples
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# UCOM annotation in examples
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {keer per dag inhaleren} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked
