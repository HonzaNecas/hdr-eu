# New warning introduced by the publisher see https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Regression.20in.20ConceptMap

The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# Warnings referred to an Obligation profile
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/tools/StructureDefinition/obligation|0.1.0 is deprecated

# usage of SNOMED CT
The IG is not for the international realm, and it uses SNOMED CT, so it should fix the SCT edition in the expansion parameters

# Missing OID foor actors
The resource ActorDefinition/actor-consumer-eu-hdr could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)
