### Authors and Contributors


This guide is the result of a multi-stakeholder effort involving experts from various European countries, projects, and initiatives.

**Major contributors and their roles:**

- The most awesome **community of volunteers**, including EHR vendors, data exchange regulators, implementers, and other enthusiastic people from across Europe — and even beyond.
- **HL7 Europe Affiliate members**, who contributed their local expertise and helped ensure alignment with national standards and priorities.
- **National/Regional Health Authorities**, who provided guidance to ensure the specifications meet real-world public health needs and policy requirements.
- **XpanDH and xShare projects**, which experimented with the future European data exchange format. This IG is a direct successor to the work initiated in XpanDH. Both XpanDH and xShare are EU-funded projects.
- **Xt-EHR Joint Action**, responsible for preparing the implementing acts for the EHDS regulation, including the exact data sets and technical specifications. To ensure alignment, their profiling team actively collaborated within the HL7 Europe working group. The profiles in this IG are based on Xt-EHR’s logical information models.
- **MyHealth@EU solution provider**, who brought valuable insights into EU cross-border data exchange. Their participation ensures that the HL7 FHIR specification remains adaptable and practical for real-world cross-border scenarios.
- **HL7 Europe**, which provides a project-agnostic platform for collaborative work, supporting both the technical and administrative development of HL7 Europe's implementation guides. This guide also builds on HL7 Europe’s Base and Core Profiles IG, developed by a similar cross-project team.

This initiative brought together more than 160 participants from around 25 countries — including several outside the EU (UAE, Saudi Arabia, USA).
