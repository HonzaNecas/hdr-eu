### Section LOINC codes

Not all the coded concepts used for the Hospital Discharge Report (HDR) sections fully align with the purpose of the HDR model and its implementation.  

A collaboration with **LOINC** has been established to identify the most appropriate codes for the HDR sections.  

This version uses temporary local codes where concepts were missing, and the closest available concepts have been used where possible, even though some issues have been identified in certain cases.  

**Adopters should be aware that codes may be subject to change.**
