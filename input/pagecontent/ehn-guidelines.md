### Overview

The European eHealth Network "GUIDELINE on the electronic exchange of health data under
Cross-Border Directive 2011/24/EU Hospital Discharge Report" - Release 1.1 is addressed to the Member States of the European Union and applies to support the exchange of Hospital Discharge Report for continuity of care in a cross-border setting.

These guidelines could serve as a guiding principle for the national development and implementation of Hospital Discharge Reports.

### eHN Data Set

The eHN Hospital Discharge Report Guideline in section 4 specifies a HOSPITAL DISCHARGE REPORT DATASET, which records all clinically relevant information pertaining to the patient’s stay in a hospital, which are essential for the continuity of care.

The Hospital Discharge Report (HDR) has two main components:

- The header and
- The body.

The **header** contains essential administrative and identification data about the patient, healthcare providers, and other key participants in the patient's care.

The **body** consists of the core clinical details regarding the patient's stay, treatment, and discharge plan.
