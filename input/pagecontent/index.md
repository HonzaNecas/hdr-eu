### Scope

Specify a set of rules to be applied to HL7 FHIR to define how to represent a **Hospital Discharge Report** in the **European** Context, coherently with the European eHN Guidelines (see the [European eHealth - Key documents](https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/key-documents_en) ).

Its main goal is to define the content components and a preferable structure to be used for composing an Hospital Discharge Report. 

This includes both jurisdictional and cross border scenarios. 

This guide doesn't describe how this report is exchanged.

### Purpose
The goal of this Implementation Guide is to define an European standard for the Hospital Discharge Report to facilitate the harmonization among the national initiatives and prepare the ground for the European EHR eXchange Format (E-EHRxF).

This project is promoted by HL7 Europe, but realized in collaboration with several other European and national organizations and projects.

The aspiration of this guide is that of being used as basis for European National Guides, the European EHRxF and - consequently - by MyHealth@EU for the EU cross-border services.

### Background

This guide is part of the group of HL7 FHIR Implementation Guides published by HL7 Europe to support the priority categories identified by the [European Health Data Space Regulation](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-76-2024-INIT/en/pdf) (EHDS).

This activity has been carried out in a neutral working space by engaging EEHRxF-related initiatives (Xt-EHR, MyHealth@EU Architecture WG, EU-funded projects), national and regional agencies, relevant stakeholders, and interested communities (e.g. EU HL7 Affiliates, IHE Europe).

More details about the project background can be found in the [background page](background.html).

### Design approach

The project design approach is described in the [Design approach page](design.html).
